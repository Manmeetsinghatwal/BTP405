# Product Vision and Management
Vision Proclamation: "Our vision is to engage people with command over their wellbeing information by giving a solid and easy to understand stage for overseeing individual wellbeing records." Item Build-up: Client verification and approval Secure capacity and encryption of wellbeing records Easy to understand interface for adding, survey, and sharing wellbeing information Joining with medical care suppliers for consistent information sharing Execution of lithe strategies for iterative turn of events and consistent improvement Nimble Techniques: Use Scrum system with run cycles enduring fourteen days. Direct run arranging gatherings to focus on accumulation things. Everyday stand-up gatherings to follow progress and address any impediments. Run audits and reviews to assemble input and plan for the following cycle.

# Agile Software Engineering
 Run Arranging: Separate overabundance things into more modest undertakings and allot them to colleagues. 
 Task Assessment: Use strategies like arranging poker to appraise the work expected for each assignment. 
 Checking Progress: Track progress utilizing burndown outlines or assignment sheets, refreshing them everyday during stand-up gatherings. 
 Transformation and Emphasis: Use criticism from run surveys and reviews to change the arrangement for the following run.

# User-Centered Design
Personas: Patient Persona: Jack, a 35-year-old individual overseeing persistent medical issue. Specialist Persona: Dr. Atwal, an essential consideration doctor who necessities admittance to patients' wellbeing records. 
Situations and User Stories: Situation: Jack needs to follow her pulse readings over the long haul to impart to her PCP. Client Story: As a patient, I need to information and track my pulse readings in the PHR framework to screen my wellbeing.

# Software Architecture
Framework Engineering: Our framework design focuses on security, versatility, and interoperability. We embrace a microservices engineering, deteriorating the application into more modest, inexactly coupled administrations, each liable for explicit business capabilities. Cloud-Based Administrations: Utilizing cloud-based administrations, for example, AWS, we have our application on EC2 occurrences and use RDS for secure capacity of wellbeing records. We bridle the versatility and unwavering quality of the cloud to guarantee ideal execution and accessibility. Information Model: We plan a hearty social data set blueprint, cautiously displaying substances, for example, clients, wellbeing records, and access control components to guarantee proficient capacity and recovery of information while keeping up with information honesty and security. 


# Cloud-Based Software Engineering : 
Cloud Administrations: Our application tackles the force of cloud administrations for facilitating, information capacity, and versatility. We influence AWS Lambda for serverless registering, S3 for putting away static resources, and DynamoDB for NoSQL information capacity. Ceaseless Coordination/Persistent Arrangement (CI/Disc): We execute CI/Cd pipelines utilizing AWS CodePipeline to computerize testing, assemble, and organization processes. This empowers us to convey updates to our application rapidly and dependably while keeping up with quality and security.

# Microservices Engineering : 
Microservices Plan: We structure our application as an assortment of inexactly coupled microservices, each epitomizing explicit business usefulness. Administrations, for example, client validation, wellbeing record the board, and information sharing work freely, advancing seclusion and versatility. Soothing APIs: We carry out Peaceful APIs to work with correspondence between microservices, sticking to industry best practices for asset naming, HTTP techniques, and payload designs. This empowers consistent cooperation and joining between various parts of our framework.

# Security and Privacy : 
Confirmation and Approval: Our framework utilizes hearty verification components, for example, JWT-based validation, to safely check the personality of clients. Job based admittance control guarantees that clients just approach the information and functionalities they are approved to utilize. Encryption: We execute start to finish encryption utilizing TLS/SSL to get information transmission among clients and servers. Also, touchy wellbeing information is scrambled very still utilizing AES encryption calculations, shielding it from unapproved access. Consistence: We stick to administrative necessities, for example, HIPAA to guarantee the protection and security of wellbeing data. Normal security reviews and infiltration testing are directed to distinguish and address expected weaknesses, guaranteeing the respectability and classification of our clients' information.
